<h1>Supported Versions</h1>

<p>
	Each release branch of PHP is fully supported for two years from its initial
	stable release. During this period, bugs and security issues that have been
	reported are fixed and are released in regular point releases.
</p>

<p>
	After this two year period of active support, each branch is then supported
	for an additional year for critical security issues only. Releases during
	this period are made on an as-needed basis: there may be multiple point
	releases, or none, depending on the number of reports.
</p>

<p>
	Once the three years of support are completed, the branch reaches its end of
	life and is no longer supported. <a href="/eol.php">A table of end of life
	branches is available.</a>
</p>
