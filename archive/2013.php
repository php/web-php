      <p>The PHP web team are delighted to announce the launch of the new web theme that has been
      in beta for many months. Lots of hard work has gone into this release and we will be continually 
      improving things over time now that we have migrated away from the legacy theme.</p>

      <p>From an aesthetics point of view the general color scheme of the website has been lightened from the
      older dark purple. Lots of borders and links use a similar purple color to attain
      consistency. Fonts are smoother, and colors, contrast and highlighting have significantly improved; especially
      on function reference pages. Code examples should now be much more readable.</p>

      <p>The theme is marked up using HTML5 and is generally much more modern. We are using Google Fonts and
      Bootstrap for our theme base.</p>

      <p>To provide valuable feedback, you can use the 'Feedback' widget on the side of the page (not visible
      on smartphones) and to report bugs, you can make use of the <a href="http://bugs.php.net" title="PHP Bug Tracker">bugs.php.net</a>
      tracker. Despite our extensive multi-device/multi-browser testing, we may have missed something. So, if you
      spot any issues please do get in touch.</p>

      <p>Special thanks to the guys who helped make this happen, you know who you are!</p>

      <p>We are continuing to work through the repercussions of the php.net malware issue described in a news post earlier today. As part of this, the php.net systems team have audited every server operated by php.net, and have found that two servers were compromised: the server which hosted the www.php.net, static.php.net and git.php.net domains, and was previously suspected based on the JavaScript malware, and the server hosting bugs.php.net. The method by which these servers were compromised is unknown at this time.</p>

      <p>All affected services have been migrated off those servers. We have verified that our Git repository was not compromised, and it remains in read only mode as services are brought back up in full.</p>

      <p>As it's possible that the attackers may have accessed the private key of the php.net SSL certificate, we have revoked it immediately. We are in the process of getting a new certificate, and expect to restore access to php.net sites that require SSL (including bugs.php.net and wiki.php.net) in the next few hours.</p>

      <p>To summarise, the situation right now is that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript malware was served to a small percentage of php.net users from the 22nd to the 24th of October 2013.</li>
        <li>Neither the source tarball downloads nor the Git repository were modified or compromised.</li>
        <li>Two php.net servers were compromised, and have been removed from service. All services have been migrated to new, secure servers.</li>
        <li>SSL access to php.net Web sites is temporarily unavailable until a new SSL certificate is issued and installed on the servers that need it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Over the next few days, we will be taking further action:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>php.net users will have their passwords reset. Note that users of PHP are unaffected by this: this is solely for people committing code to projects hosted on svn.php.net or git.php.net.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will provide a full post mortem in due course, most likely next week. You can also get updates from the official php.net Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/official_php">@official_php</a>.</p>

      <p>
      On 24 Oct 2013 06:15:39 +0000 Google started saying www.php.net was hosting
      malware. The Google Webmaster Tools were initially quite delayed in showing
      the reason why and when they did it looked a lot like a false positive
      because we had some minified/obfuscated javascript being dynamically
      injected into userprefs.js. This looked suspicious to us as well, but
      it was actually written to do exactly that so we were quite certain it
      was a false positive, but we kept digging.
      </p>

      <p>
      It turned out that by combing through the access logs for static.php.net
      it was periodically serving up userprefs.js with the wrong content length
      and then reverting back to the right size after a few minutes. This is due
      to an rsync cron job. So the file was being modified locally and reverted.
      Google's crawler caught one of these small windows where the wrong file
      was being served, but of course, when we looked at it manually it looked
      fine. So more confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
      We are still investigating how someone caused that file to be changed,
      but in the meantime we have migrated www/static to new clean servers.
      The highest priority is obviously the source code integrity and after
      a quick:
      </p>

      <blockquote>git fsck --no-reflog --full --strict</blockquote>

      <p>
      on all our repos plus manually checking the md5sums of the PHP distribution
      files we see no evidence that the PHP code has been compromised. We have
      a mirror of our git repos on github.com and we will manually check git
      commits as well and have a full post-mortem on the intrusion when we have
      a clearer picture of what happened.

      <p>
      <a href="http://codeconnexx.com/">CodeConnexx</a> is a two-day, one track conference that aims to bring together everyone interested in talking about code.
      </p>
      <p>
      As we know, choosing a career as a coder comes with its own set of life
      challenges, and we want to talk about those too. In short, this conference is a
      different kind of conference, as it connects those two pieces of the puzzle
      together in one event.
      </p>

      <p>
      Every technical talk will be followed by a talk about life skills and work/life
      balance. There will also be plenty of social opportunities to get to know the
      other attendees. Not only do we want to help you bridge the gap between work
      and life, we want to help you connect with each other as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      CodeConnexx, hosted by <a href="http://phpwomen.org/">PHPWomen</a>, will
      take <a href="http://codeconnexx.com/location/">place</a> in Maastricht,
      Netherlands on November 8th &amp; 9th 2013. We sincerely hope you are able to
      join us!

      <p>We weren't trying to pull an April Fool's Day joke in May.  A temporary glitch caused the latest distributions of PHP to not properly propagate to the mirror servers.  This has been fixed at the root level, and it's now being distributed to all of the mirrors.  We'll take some bacon to go with the egg on our faces, please!</p>

      <p>If you continue to experience issues with downloading these versions after 21:00 UTC on 9 May, 2013, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:php-mirrors@lists.php.net">php-mirrors@lists.php.net</a>, telling us from which mirror you're trying to download, and we'll get it resolved.</p>

      Ibuildings is proud to organise the seventh Dutch PHP Conference on June 7 and
      8, plus a pre-conference tutorial day on June 6. Both programs will be
      completely in English so the only Dutch thing about it is the location.
      </p>

      <p>
      This year we have 30+ speakers gathering in Amsterdam. The 3-track main
      conference covers topics like PHP 5.5, software design, APIs, Zend Framework 2,
      Symfony 2, security, scalability and more. Our Tutorial Day has an additional
      16 in-depth sessions to choose from.
      </p>

      <p>
      Your DPC ticket also lets you into the Dutch Mobile Conference: an additional
      two tracks about cutting edge javascript and non-native application
      development. This year features several side events: a bigger and better
      unconference, a Zend sponsored hackathon, a social in downtown Amsterdam, and a
      Symfony2 certification exam.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Early Bird special ends April 28th, so book right away for a 15% discount.
      We look forward to seeing you in June!

      <a href="http://www.phpsouthafrica.com/">PHPSouthAfrica</a> is a 2
      day conference (October 4th &amp; 5th) to be hosted in the most
      beautiful city in the world, Cape Town South Africa.  It is aimed

      developers.
      </p>
      <p>
      PHP is one of the most popular web programming languages used today
      to power most websites. As the language continues to grow stronger,
      PHP has now been linked with mobile powered applications. We are
      noticing a migration from mobile language applications to web based
      technologies (JavaScript, HTML5,CSS).
      </p>
      <p>
      PHPSouthAfrica has been a long time coming. With the increased
      demand for PHP programmers, not only locally but also
      internationally, our vision is to marry the latest technologies
      with international speakers. We are creating a conference that
      will hone established developers, but also assist up and coming
      programmers develop and learn new skills.With the conference
      based in Cape Town, it gives us the opportunity to showcase
      “The Mother City,” voted one of the top 10 places to visit and
      home of Table Mountain- one of the New7Wonders of Nature.
