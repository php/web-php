        <p>The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.2.8. This release addresses a regression introduced by 5.2.7 in regard to the magic_quotes functionality, which was broken by an incorrect fix to the filter extension. All users who have upgraded to 5.2.7 are encouraged to upgrade to this release.  Alternatively you can apply a work-around for the bug by changing "filter.default_flags=0" in php.ini.</p>

        Due to a security bug found in the PHP 5.2.7 release, it has been removed from distribution.
        The bug affects configurations where <a href="/magic_quotes">magic_quotes_gpc</a> is enabled,
        because it remains off even when set to on.
        In the meantime, use PHP <a href="/releases/5_2_6.php">5.2.6</a> until PHP 5.2.8 is later released.

        <div>
        <p>The PHP development team is proud to announce the <a href="http://qa.php.net/">third alpha release</a>

        of the upcoming PHP 5.3.0 minor version update of PHP.
        Several new features have already been documented in the <a href="http://php.net/docs.php">official documentation</a>,
        others are listed on the <a href="http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53">wiki</a>
        in preparation of getting documented. It is imperative that more people
        join the effort to complete the documentation for PHP 5.3.0.
        Please also review the <a href="http://php.net/php5news">NEWS</a> file.</p>
        <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
         participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
         necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
         report any findings to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailinglist</a>

         or the <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bug tracker</a>.</p>
        <p>There have been a great number of other additions and improvements since the last alpha,
        but here is a short overview of the most important changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://php.net/language.namespaces">Namespaces</a> (documentation has been updated to the current state)</li>
          <li>

            <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/rounding">Rounding behavior</a>
          </li>
          <li>ext/msql has been removed, while ext/ereg will now raise E_DEPRECATED notices</li>
          <li>ext/mhash has been replaced by ext/hash but full BC is maintained</li>
          <li>PHP now uses cc as the default compiler, instead of gcc</li>
          <li>A number of bug fixes to ext/pdo, ext/soap, the stream layer among others</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing
        applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized.</p>
        <p>The current <a href="http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53">release plan</a> expects
        a stable release sometime around the end of Q1 2009.</p>

    <div class="entry-content description">

        <div>
        <p>The PHP development team is proud to announce the <a href="http://qa.php.net/">first alpha release</a> of the upcoming minor version update of PHP. <a href="http://windows.php.net/download/">Windows binaries</a> will be available starting with alpha2 (intermediate snapshots available at <a href="http://snaps.php.net">snaps.php.net</a>). The new version PHP 5.3 is expected to improve stability and performance as well as add new language syntax and extensions. Several new features have already been documented in the <a href="http://php.net/docs.php">official documentation</a>, others are listed on the <a href="http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53">wiki</a> in preparation of getting documented. Please also review the <a href="http://php.net/php5news">NEWS</a> file.</p>

        <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
         participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
         necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
         report any findings to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailinglist</a>
         or the <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bug tracker</a>.</p>
        <p>There have been a great number of other additions and improvements, but here is a short overview of the most important changes:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><a href="http://php.net/language.namespaces">Namespaces</a> (documentation maybe out dated)</li>
          <li><a href="http://php.net/oop5.late-static-bindings">Late static binding</a> and <a href="http://php.net/language.oop5.overloading">__callStatic</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures">Lambda functions and closures</a>
          </li>

          <li>Addition of the <a href="http://php.net/book.intl">intl</a>, <a href="http://php.net/book.phar">phar</a> (phar is scheduled for some more work a head of alpha2), <a href="http://php.net/book.fileinfo">fileinfo </a> and <a href="http://php.net/book.sqlite3">sqlite3</a> extensions</li>
          <li>Optional cyclic garbage collection</li>

          <li>Optional support for the <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/PHP_MYSQLND">MySQLnd</a> replacement driver for libmysql</li>
          <li>Windows older than Windows 2000 (Windows 98, NT4, etc.) are not supported anymore (<a href="http://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/releasenotes">details</a>)</li>
          <li>New syntax features like <a href="http://php.net/language.types.string#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc">NOWDOC</a>, limited GOTO, ternary short cut "?:"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized. This is especially important for users that require the undocumented Zend engine multibyte support.</p>
        <p>The current <a href="http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53">release plan</a> states that there will be alpha/beta/RC releases in 2-3 week intervals with an expected stable release of PHP 5.3 between mid September and mid October of 2008.</p>

        <p>Overall 158 tests have been submitted as part of <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest 2008</a> since the launch of the <a href="http://testfest.php.net">TestFest submission site</a> by 30 different people from people all over the world. Actually this is not counting the various submissions by existing core developers, who also took this opportunity to add some more tests. This has actually increased total <a href="http://gcov.php.net/" target="_new">test coverage</a> for ext/reflection, ext/dom and ext/exif by about 10% each. While the organization of the TestFest was a bit adhoc, there were numerous TestFest events in local user groups. So the number of people exposed to the PHP test framework is much greater. Hopefully this will lead to more people submitting bug reports with an accompanying <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">phpt</a> test file!</p>

        <p>Our top submitter Felix De Vliegher has actually committed his last submissions himself since, based on the high quality of his submissions, he has been granted commit rights to the PHP repository. We have not heard back from all participants, but we encourage everybody to <a href="http://www.deshong.net/?p=76" target="_new">blog</a> about their experience and provide us with feedback on how to improve future events.</p>
        <p>Now better late than never, here are the 10 winners of the promised <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/elephpants/pool/">elePHPant</a> raffle sponsored by <a href="http://www.nexen.net">Nexen</a>. Note that Felix asked me not to include him in the raffle, since he is already herding quite a number of elePHPants at home.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eric Stewart</li>

          <li>H√•vard Eide</li>
          <li>Marc Veldman</li>
          <li>Michelangelo van Dam</li>
          <li>Rein Velt</li>
          <li>Rob Young</li>
          <li>Sami Greenbury</li>

          <li>Sebastian Deutsch</li>
          <li>Sebastian Sch√ºrmann</li>
          <li>Stefan Koopmanschap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide Nexen with the email addresses of the winners, so that they can arrange to get the elePHPants shipped. Also for those people wondering, you can continue to submit tests on the <a href="http://testfest.php.net">TestFest submission site</a>. A bit thank you to all participants and TestFest organizers! Without the countless people that helped organize local events, implement the infrastructure and submissions reviewers, the TestFest would have obviously not worked out as well as it has. We will surely do similar events in the future based on the big success of TestFest 2008.</p>

        <p>The PHP-QA team would like to announce the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest</a> for the month of
        May 2008. The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the
        <a href="http://gcov.php.net">code coverage</a> of the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php">test suite</a> for the PHP
        language itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are
        invited to join the TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come
        together virtually. The point however is that people network to learn
        together. Aside from being an opportunity for all of you to make friends
        with like minded people in your (virtual) community, it also will
        hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net mentors.</p>

        <p>All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and
        to get others involved in
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">writing phpt tests</a>.
        The submissions will then be reviewed by members of php.net before
        getting included in the official test suite. Please visit the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest homepage</a> to get
        additional details on the TestFest on how to get involved, either as a
        UG or by setting up the necessary infrastructure.</p>
