<h1>A Note on Security in PHP</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[31-Dec-2004]</span>
 The PHP Development Team has issued an <a href="/security-note.php">important
 statement</a> that deals with the security of PHP, and of PHP-based applications.
 The trigger for releasing this statement was the growing misconception in the PHP
 community regarding recent security problems, which exploited bugs
 in PHP applications, rather than bugs in PHP itself.  It's a recommended read
 for anybody using PHP.

<h1>Function list suggestions available</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[27-Dec-2004]</span>
 Surely, some of our visitors are back at work for a few days between
 holidays, and hopefully they will find our post-christmas gift useful.
 The function list suggestions we started to test a year ago seemed to
 be working better as some bugs were found and fixed, so it was time to
 make the result available on all php.net pages.
</p>
<p>
 Whenever you type something into the search field, while having the
 function list search option selected, you will get a list of suggested
 functions starting with the letters you typed in. You can browse the list
 with the up/down keys, and you will be able to autocomplete the function
 name with the spacebar.
</p>
<p>
 If you are not interested in this feature, you can turn it
 off for yourself on the <a href="/my.php">My PHP.net</a> page.
