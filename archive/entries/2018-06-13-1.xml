          <p>The teams at <a href="https://www.phparch.com">php[architect]</a> and <a href="http://www.oneforall.events" title="One for All Events">One for All Events</a>
          are excited to announce we have opened up our <a href="https://world.phparch.com/call-for-speakers/?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">Call for Speakers</a>
          for the 5th annual <a href="https://world.phparch.com/?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">php[world]</a>.</p>

               <p>This year we are wanting to provide our attendees deep-dive content which teach core lessons about PHP. We also want talks covering
               advanced topics in applications and frameworks built in PHP (such as Drupal, WordPress, Laravel, Symfony, and Magento).
               We encourage submissions on technologies crucial to modern Web development such as HTML5, JavaScript, and emerging technologies.
                Ideas surrounding the entire software life cycle are often big hits for our attendees. Finally, we do welcome non-technical
                proposals that will appeal to a developer audience.</p>

               <p>Like last year, we will be a 2-day conference with concurrent workshops, preceded by two days of training classes.
               Also like last year, we will have our comprehensive speaker package available which includes:</p>

               <ul>
               <li>A free conference ticket</li>
               <li>Round-trip economy airfare booked by us</li>
               <li>Accommodations at the conference hotel:
               <ul>
               <li>3 nights for speakers</li>
               <li>5 nights for training teachers</li>
               </ul></li>
               </ul>

               <p>Don't hesitate, the <a href="https://world.phparch.com/call-for-speakers/?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">Call for Speakers</a>
