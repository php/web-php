     <p>The PHP web team are delighted to announce the launch of the new web theme that has been
    in beta for many months. Lots of hard work has gone into this release and we will be continually
    improving things over time now that we have migrated away from the legacy theme.</p>

    <p>From an aesthetics point of view the general color scheme of the website has been lightened from the
      older dark purple. Lots of borders and links use a similar purple color to attain
      consistency. Fonts are smoother, and colors, contrast and highlighting have significantly improved; especially
      on function reference pages. Code examples should now be much more readable.</p>

     <p>The theme is marked up using HTML5 and is generally much more modern. We are using Google Fonts and
      Bootstrap for our theme base.</p>

     <p>To provide valuable feedback, you can use the 'Feedback' widget on the side of the page (not visible
      on smartphones) and to report bugs, you can make use of the <a href="http://bugs.php.net" title="PHP Bug Tracker">bugs.php.net</a>
      tracker. Despite our extensive multi-device/multi-browser testing, we may have missed something. So, if you
      spot any issues please do get in touch.</p>

     <p>Special thanks to the guys who helped make this happen, you know who you are!</p>
