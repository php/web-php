     <p>The team at NortheastPHP is excited to annouce that the Call for Speakers is open for our 2016 conference.</p>
     
     <p>This 5th annual conference that is focused on community is moving to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island! We have a number of other updates that will be announced in the coming months as well.</p>
     
     <p>For now, we want to hear from you! We want to hear what talk ideas you have. Without our speakers, there would be no conference. We offer a very comprehensive speakers package as well.</p>
     
     <p>Don't hesitate! Our Call for Speakers will be closed before you know it. So you only have a short time to get those submissions in. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
