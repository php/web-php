        One day, three tracks, more fun than a barrel of elePHPants!
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us for a one day, three-track conference that focuses on PHP and
        related web technologies. This event is organized by Madison PHP and is
        designed to offer something to attendees at all skill levels. It will
        be a day of networking, learning, sharing, and great fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Three Tracks</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We've carefully crafted three distinct tracks but you're not locked
        into just one. Attend any talk from any track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PHP Foundations Track</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Learn the basics of PHP development. A carefully selected set of talks
        for those who have never programmed before or who are new to PHP and
        would like a refresher of the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PHP Professional Track (2x)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore new technologies and techniques. Gather with other seasoned
        developers and increase your value with a series of talks that will
        both energize and get you excited about the future of PHP.
