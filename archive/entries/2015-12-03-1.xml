     <p>
     The inconvenience of the release lateness in several time zones is caused by the need to ensure the
     compatibility with the latest OpenSSL 1.0.2e release. Thanks for the patience!
     </p>

     <p>
     It is not just a next major PHP version being released today.
     The release being introduced is an outcome of the almost two years development
     journey. It is a very special accomplishment of the core team. And, it is a
     result of incredible efforts of many active community members.
     Indeed, it is not just a final release being brought out today, it is the rise of
     a new PHP generation with an enormous potential.
     </p>

     <p>Congratulations everyone to this spectacular day for the PHP world!</p>
     <p>Grateful thanks to all the contributors and supporters!</p>
