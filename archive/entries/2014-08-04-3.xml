        <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest</a> is the annual conference
        dedicated to the CakePHP framework and related technologies, hosting
        live workshops, and inviting a variety of great speakers, to give the
        very best in presentations and talks on the latest from the community.
        This year the conference comes to Madrid, Spain, and takes place from
        August 21st until August 24th.

        The workshops are a great way to learn CakePHP, and get up-to-date with
        the latest version 3.0 and innovations directly from the core
        developers, while the conference days are packed with presentations,
        discussions and talks, and an ideal moment to learn more from
        the community.
      </p>

        It's a great opportunity to network, meet friends old and new, and have
        some fun with the core members of the project. Plus, there's cake!
