     <p>Now for the 3rd year the team behind the original php[cruise] is bringing a conference to the open seas. <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/?utm_campaign=ccphp19">CoderCruise 2019</a> will be a premiere conference experience, giving you an exclusive connection to your fellow community members. It will set sail from Port Canaveral on August 19th for a 5 day cruise that also visits Princess Cays and Nassau!</p>
     <p>Just like last year we've negotiated a low rate for our participants that is all inclusive, <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/register/?utm_campaign=ccphp19">starting as low as $435</a> per person (including 5-day cruise, food, drink <b>and the conference</b>!)</p>
     <p>Our <a href="https://www.papercall.io/codercruise-2019?utm_campaign=ccphp19">Call for Speakers</a> is open until March 3rd, and we invite you to send us your talk proposals. We want to hear from you, as do others!</p>
