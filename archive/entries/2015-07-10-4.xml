        The PHP development team announces the immediate availability of
        PHP 7.0.0 Beta 1. This is the third pre-release of the new PHP 7
        major series. All users of PHP are encouraged to test this version carefully,
        and report any bugs and incompatibilities in <a href="https://bugs.php.net">the bug tracking system</a>.
     </p>

     <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO <u>NOT</u> USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>

     <p>
     Beta 1 marks the feature complete phase. From now on, fundamental
     changes are not to be expected. What's more, this release brings
     over 200 commits with about 25 reported bug fixes, as well as security,
     stability and other improvements. However it was delayed to catch up with
     the latest OpenSSL release issued on July 9th.
     </p>

     <p>
      PHP 7.0.0 comes with new version of the Zend Engine with features such as (incomplete list):
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Improved performance: PHP 7 is up to twice as fast as PHP 5.6</li>
        <li>Consistent 64-bit support</li>
        <li>Many fatal errors are now Exceptions</li>
        <li>Removal of old and unsupported SAPIs and extensions</li>
        <li>The null coalescing operator (??)</li>
        <li>Combined comparison Operator (&lt;=&gt;)</li>
        <li>Return Type Declarations</li>
