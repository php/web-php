	<p>The International PHP Conference is a globally recognized event for PHP developers, webworkers, IT managers and everyone interested in web technology.</p>
	<p>Once again, the conference will explore key topics and core technologies for developers and decision makers. We will show you how to scale your applications, explain the details of Continuous Integration or evaluate different approaches to NoSQL. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet with speakers, core developers and consultants, and there are often opportunities to evaluate your code. Community and enterprise projects profit from our international reputation and impulses given from the developer community.
