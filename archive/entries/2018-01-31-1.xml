<p>Once again the team behind the original php[cruise] is bringing a conference to the open seas. <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/">CoderCruise 2018</a> will be a premiere conference experience, letting you have an exclusive connection to your fellow community members. It will set sail from Ft. Lauderdale on August 30th for a 5 day cruise that also visits Half Moon Cay and Nassau!</p>
<p>Best of all, this year we've managed to negotiate a much cheaper overall rate for our participants, starting as low as $410 per person (including 5-day cruise, food, drink <b>and the conference!</b>)</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.codercruise.com/call-for-speakers/">Call for Speakers</a> is open until <b>February 28th</b>, and we invite you to come give us your submissions. We want to hear from you, as do others!</p>
