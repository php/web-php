     <p>Speakers, the call for papers is now open! We’re looking for high-quality, technical sessions from
     speakers who can cover advanced topics and keep our demanding audience inspired. The call for
     papers is open until February 16th. You can send in as many proposals as you like, so start submitting
     your talks. We’re very excited to see what you can come up with, and we’re looking forward to
