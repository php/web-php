     As <a href="https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/113838">announced</a>
     on the php.internals mailing list, a pair of
     <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/c730aa26bd52829a49f2ad284b181b7e82a68d7d">malicious</a>
     <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/2b0f239b211c7544ebc7a4cd2c977a5b7a11ed8a">commits</a>
     were made in the PHP source code repository over the weekend.
     <i>These commits were immediately noticed and reverted,
     and thus <b>never reached end users</b>.</i>
     The investigation into the root cause and exact scope of the
     compromise is still ongoing, therefore releases will be put
     on hold for two weeks assuming no further issues are discovered.

     Thank you for bearing with us while we endeavor to ensure that
     PHP is a stable and reliable platform for web development.
