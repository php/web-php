     	With great pleasure we would like to announce the 7th edition of
     PHPBenelux Conference 2016 which will take place on January 29 and 30,
     2016 in Antwerp, Belgium.
     </p><p>
     PHPBenelux is a great conference bringing local and foreign speakers
     to an international crowd where the main language is English to allow
     foreigners to feel comfortable talking with others, inspiring the
     hallway tracks between and after the sessions.
     </p><p>
     On the first day in the morning we offer 3-hour tutorials by experts
     to get hands-down experience on the subjects offered. The afternoon
     and second day are all devoted to multi-track hour sessions about
     trends, best practices and solutions for common PHP development
     challenges. Each evening we provide a social event for people to
     network and socialize in a friendly, unpressured environment.
     </p><p>
     The "Call for Papers" is open until October 14 if you have interest
     presenting at PHPBenelux Conference 2016. Check out our
