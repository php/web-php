     The PHP development team announces the immediate availability of PHP 7.2.0 RC6.
     This release is the sixth Release Candidate for 7.2.0.
     Barring any surprises, <b>we expect this to be the FINAL release candidate</b>,
     with Nov 30th's GA release being not-substantially different.
     All users of PHP are encouraged to test this version carefully, and report any bugs
     and incompatibilities in the <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">bug tracking system</a>.
