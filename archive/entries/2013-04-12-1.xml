            <a href="http://www.phpsouthafrica.com/">PHPSouthAfrica</a> is a 2
            day conference (October 4th &amp; 5th) to be hosted in the most
            beautiful city in the world, Cape Town South Africa.  It is aimed
            at proficient developers, new developers and people who care about
            developers.

        <p>
            PHP is one of the most popular web programming languages used today
            to power most websites. As the language continues to grow stronger,
            PHP has now been linked with mobile powered applications. We are
            noticing a migration from mobile language applications to web based
            technologies (JavaScript, HTML5,CSS).
        </p>
        <p>
            PHPSouthAfrica has been a long time coming. With the increased
            demand for PHP programmers, not only locally but also
            internationally, our vision is to marry the latest technologies
            with international speakers. We are creating a conference that
            will hone established developers, but also assist up and coming
            programmers develop and learn new skills.With the conference
            based in Cape Town, it gives us the opportunity to showcase
            “The Mother City,” voted one of the top 10 places to visit and
            home of Table Mountain- one of the New7Wonders of Nature.
