     <p>The team at <a href="https://www.phparch.com/">php[architect]</a> is excited to annouce that the <a href="https://tek.phparch.com/call-for-speakers/">Call for Speakers</a> is open for <a href="https://tek.phparch.com/">php[tek] 2016</a>.</p>
     
     <p>This 11th annual conference that is focused on community is this year moving to a <a href="https://tek.phparch.com/location-hotel/">bigger venue in Saint Louis</a> so that we can expand and give our attendees some elbow room!  We have a number of other updates that will be announced in the coming months as well.</p>
     
     <p>But right now, we want to hear from you!  We want to hear what talk ideas you have.  Without our speakers, there would be no conference.  We offer a very comprehensive speakers package, including:</p>
     
     <ul>
     <li>Airfare coverage (up to $400 domestic, $1000 international)</li>
     <li>Hotel Room (1 night + 1 per accepted talk)</li>
     <li>Free ticket to the conference, including Tutorial Day</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Don't hesitate!  Our <a href="https://tek.phparch.com/call-for-speakers/">Call for Speakers</a> closes on <strong>January 16th, 2016</strong>.  So you only have a few weeks to get those submissions in.  We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
