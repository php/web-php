     <strong>About the conference</strong><br/>
     PHP Conference Kansai is a large-scale technical conference in Japan for PHP engineers to share their technical knowledge and experiences in and around PHP.
     It has been held 9 times in the past since 2011, and each time the topic is the latest information and trends in PHP at that time.
