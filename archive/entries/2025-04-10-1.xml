                A focused security audit of the PHP source code (<a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a>) was recently completed, commissioned by the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a>, organized by <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">The PHP Foundation</a> in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>, and performed by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/">Quarkslab</a>. The audit targeted the most critical parts of the codebase, leading to 27 findings, 17 with security implications, including four CVEs.
