                The PHP development team announces the 5th
                <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
                PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy
                (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the
                <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the 5th release candidate. The release candidate phase is intended as
                a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new features should
                be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0.
            </p>
            <p>
                We got a lot of feedback that helped us to improve the upcoming
                PHP version.  Please continue to help us to identify bugs in
                order to ensure that the release is solid and all things behave
                as expected. Please take the time to test this release candidate
                against your code base and report any problems that you encounter
                to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailing list</a> and/or
                the <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A complete list of changes since the last release candidate can be
                found at <a href="https://svn.php.net/repository/php/php-src/tags/php_5_4_0RC5/NEWS">NEWS</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next and probably last release candidate will be released in 14 days.
