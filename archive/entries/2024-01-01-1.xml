     We are excited to announce the PHP Conference Kansai 2024. ðŸŽ‰
     </p>
     <p>
     <strong>About the conference</strong><br/>
     PHP Conference Kansai is a large-scale technical conference in Japan for PHP engineers to share their technical knowledge and experiences in and around PHP.
     It has been held 8 times in the past since 2011, and each time the topic is the latest information and trends in PHP at that time.
     This conference is the first time in 6 years. It is being restarted to create a place where PHP engineers in Kansai can exchange information with each other and improve themselves as engineers.
     On the day of the event, there will be lectures by engineers who have been invited from the general public, as well as other events to share information.
