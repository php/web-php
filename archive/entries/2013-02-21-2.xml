        The PHP development team announces the release of PHP 5.5.0alpha5.
        This release fixes some bugs from alpha4 and adds some new features.
        All users of PHP are encouraged to test this version carefully,
        and report any bugs in <a href="https://bugs.php.net">the bug tracking system</a>.

     <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>

     <p>
      PHP 5.5.0alpha5 is shipped with new features and improvements. Here is an incomplete list:
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Added the ability to change the tmp dir PHP will use during runtime, using a new php.ini
        entry,
        </li>
        <li>Added mysqli_begin_transaction()/mysqli::begin_transaction(). Implemented all
            options, per MySQL 5.6, which can be used with START TRANSACTION, COMMIT
            and ROLLBACK through options to mysqli_commit()/mysqli_rollback() and their
            respective OO counterparts.
            These changes are reflected in the mysqlnd API as well,
        </li>
        <li>
            Added recvmsg() and sendmsg() wrappers for ext/sockets
        </li>
     </ul>

      can be found on <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">windows.php.net/qa/</a>.
     </p>

     <p>
      Alpha5 is the last alpha for PHP 5.5. There has been a delay in alpha releases due to late coming new features.
      We are now beginning the betas, and the first beta
      is expected for March 7th. Betas won't add any new features, except the first one, but consolidate the source
      code and fix found bugs.
     </p>

     <p>
        Thank you for supporting PHP.
