        The PHP development team announces the immediate availability of PHP 5.6.0beta4.
        As we entered the feature freeze with beta1, this is a bugfix-only release.
        All users of PHP are encouraged to test this version carefully, and report any
        bugs in <a href="https://bugs.php.net">the bug tracking system</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The beta phase is officially closed with this release. A couple of RCs are to be
        expected, until we are confident that the release is stable enough for the final
        release. For that, we really need your help in testing and reporting any problems
        that you encounter.
      </p>

      <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>

      <p>
