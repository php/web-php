     <p>This year a number of changes have been made based upon attendee feedback, the biggest being an over 50% a drop in cost, with <a href="https://world.phparch.com/register?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">tickets available</a> now as low as $325.  The conference also is now just 2 days long, running on November 15th &amp; 16th, and includes workshops as well as regular sessions.</p>

     <p>Monday &amp; Tuesday before the conference are filled with multiple full-day training classes taught by experts in their fields.</p>

     <p>Overall we received amazing submissions to the Call for Speakers and the <a href="https://world.phparch.com/schedule?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">schedule this year</a> we believe to be one of our best yet.  Don't miss out on the highly reduced cost this year!
