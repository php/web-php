     <p>This year a number of changes have been made based upon attendee feedback, the biggest being an over 50% a drop in cost, with <a href="https://world.phparch.com/register?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">tickets available</a> now as low as $325.  The conference also is now just 2 days long, running on November 15th &amp; 16th, and includes workshops as well as regular sessions.</p>

     <p>Monday &amp; Tuesday before the conference are filled with multiple full-day training classes taught by experts in their fields.</p>

     <p>Overall we received amazing submissions to the Call for Speakers and the <a href="https://world.phparch.com/schedule?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">schedule this year</a> we believe to be one of our best yet.  Don't miss out on the highly reduced cost this year!  We look forward to seeing everyone in D.C. this fall for an amazing 2 days of <a href="https://world.phparch.com/schedule?paref=phpnet&amp;utm_campaign=phpnet">professional PHP content</a> at the best price around.</p>
