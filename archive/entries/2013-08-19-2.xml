     <a href="http://codeconnexx.com/">CodeConnexx</a> is a two-day, one track conference that aims to bring together everyone interested in talking about code.
     </p>
     <p>
     As we know, choosing a career as a coder comes with its own set of life
     challenges, and we want to talk about those too. In short, this conference is a
     different kind of conference, as it connects those two pieces of the puzzle
     together in one event.
     </p>

     <p>
     Every technical talk will be followed by a talk about life skills and work/life
     balance. There will also be plenty of social opportunities to get to know the
     other attendees. Not only do we want to help you bridge the gap between work
     and life, we want to help you connect with each other as well.
     </p>

     <p>
         CodeConnexx, hosted by <a href="http://phpwomen.org/">PHPWomen</a>, will
     take <a href="http://codeconnexx.com/location/">place</a> in Maastricht,
     Netherlands on November 8th &amp; 9th 2013. We sincerely hope you are able to
     join us!
