      <p>
        The PHP team is pleased to announce the seventh testing release of PHP 8.0.0, Beta 4.
        This point in the release cycle would normally be RC1, however we're still finalizing
        development of the JIT and squaring away named arguments, so we've opted for an extra
        beta release with plans to start the RC cycle in two weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time, we're not planning to adjust the GA date,
        however this may change during the course of the RC cycle.
        The updated release schedule can, as always, be found on the
        <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php80">PHP Wiki</a>.
      </p>
