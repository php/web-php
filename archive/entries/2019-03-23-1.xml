     <a href="https://www.middevcon.com/?utm_campaign=phpnet">Mid-Atlantic Developer Conference</a> is a 2nd year polyglot event taking place August 1-2, 2019 near Baltimore, MD.
     It is designed to bring together programmers from the region for two full days of learning from each other and
     building a stronger regional community. We are currently hosting an open <a href="https://www.middevcon.com/call-for-speakers/?utm_campaign=phpnet">Call for Speakers</a>, which will end on April 13th!
     </p>

     <p>
     We are looking for a broad range of submissions covering a wide range of topics that are of
     interest to today’s computer developers. This means not only programming topics, such as various
     sessions on PHP, but also broader topics related to development such as: deployment, DevOps, databases,
     caching, performance, scalability, APIs, etc — We also are looking for non-technical proposals that will
     appeal to a tech audience: open source, leadership, mentoring, health, work-life balance, management, customer service, and more!
     </p>

     <p>
     Given the nature of the event, extra emphasis will be placed on submissions that appeal to a larger range of developers,
     as well as submissions from more local/regional presenters.
