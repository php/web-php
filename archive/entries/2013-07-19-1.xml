              This year’s Northeast PHP Conference will once again be held in
              Boston, MA from August 16 to 18. This year we are adding a day to the
              front of the weekend for half-day workshops.

              work on. He is currently a Founding Partner &amp; CTO of Musketeers.me,
              and the Managing Editor of php|architect magazine. He is also an avid
              writer (blogs, articles and books), and has spoken at numerous
              conferences.
          </p>
          <p>and Terry Chay</p>
