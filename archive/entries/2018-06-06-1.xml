      <p><a href="https://southeastphp.com">Southeast PHP</a> is a two-day, regional PHP conference that brings the community together to learn and grow. We're bringing the community conference to Nashville, TN which hasn't had a conference since the old PHP Community Conference back in 2011! We will have two full days of amazing talks from members of our community talking about security, framework-less php, deployment and more!</p>
      <p>The conference is scheduled to run <strong>August 16th - August 17th</strong>, at the beautiful <a href="https://www.hotelpreston.com/">Hotel Preston</a>. We welcome developers and enthusiasts of all skill levels to come join us while we discuss the latest trends and technologies in our industry. You can use the code `SOUTHEAST` to reserve a room today!</p>
      <p>We look forward to seeing you in Nashville, and making the first ever <a href="https://southeastphp.com">Southeast PHP Conference</a> a huge success.</p>
