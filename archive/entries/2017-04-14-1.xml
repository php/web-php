        We are glad to announce that we’ll be organizing the 11th edition of the Dutch PHP Conference, which will be
        held in Amsterdam from June 29th to July 1st 2017. Thursday 29th will be the tutorial day and June 30th and July
        1st will be the main conference days. DPC brings together the best speakers and PHP, Javascript and front-end
        talent from Europe and beyond for three days of high-level technical sessions. Our
        <a href="https://www.phpconference.nl/schedule" title="Schedule | Dutch PHP conference">schedule</a>
        is already online and features a variety of talks on PHP, DevOps, Security &amp; privacy, microservices, JavaScript,
        databases and much more; so come along to our two main conference days on June 30 and July 1 in Amsterdam.
      </p>

        <strong>In-depth tutorial sessions</strong><br/>
        The tutorial day on Thursday June 29 at the same venue gives an opportunity for a smaller number of attendees to
        spend some time with an expert, going in-depth on particular topics - topics like Docker, domain modelling, Mob
        programming, ES6, Drupal8, Progressive Web Apps and more are all on offer. These are small groups so that
        presenters can respond to individual questions, and as a result places are limited.
      </p>
