      Alpha5 is the last alpha for PHP5.5. There has been a delay in alpha releases due to late coming new features.
      We are now beginning the betas, and the first beta
      is expected for March 7th. Betas won't add any new features, except the first one, but consolidate the source
      code and fix found bugs.

        Thank you for supporting PHP.
