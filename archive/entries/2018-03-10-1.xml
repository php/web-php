     Seems like only yesterday we were packing up and heading home from a successful second year of ScotlandPHP, it was great to see you there and we hope that you took a lot from the day!
     
     We are delighted to announce we are back in 2018 to do it all again! We will be staying put this year at the EICC in Edinburgh but the date has shifted forward a little to the 6th of October. Make sure to stick it in your diary!
     
     As ScotlandPHP is a community run event we want you to get involved in making sure this years event is bigger, better and more accessible than ever before.
