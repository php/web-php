 Starting from today, your browser's "Accept Language" setting is also

 like to get to the documentation page of echo for example, you can use
 the <a href="/echo">/echo</a> shortcut on all mirror sites, if your
 browser is set to provide your language preference information to the
 server. This also makes the PHP error message links point to the
 documentation in your preferred language.
