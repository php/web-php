     <p>ConFoo is one of the most important developer-oriented conferences loaded with PHP content. ConFoo 2013 will be held on February 25 through March 1 in Montreal, Canada.</p>
     
     <p>The team just opened its call for papers. Candidates can submit proposals <b>until September 23</b>. Consult the <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers">call for papers</a> page for details and to start submitting. That page also explains what expenses ConFoo can cover for speakers. You can even get <a href="http://confoo.ca/en/call-for-papers/guidelines">advice</a> on how to write proposals.</p>
     
     <p>The call for papers is public, meaning that all proposals get published on the website for others to vote and comment on. This approach allows the organizers to pick subjects that have most interest in the community. The comments are only visible to speakers and organizers to avoid influencing the votes.</p>
     
     <p>To stay in touch via Twitter, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/confooca">@confooca</a> and use the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23confoo">#confoo</a> tag.

        <div>
    <p>PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described
    in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use
    an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use <strong>$*</strong>
    instead of <strong>"$@"</strong> to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of
    issues. Again, people using mod_php or php-fpm are not affected.</p>

    <p>
    One way to address these CGI issues is to reject the request if the query string
    contains a '-' and no '='. It can be done using Apache's mod_rewrite like this:

    <pre>
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
    RewriteRule .? - [F,L]
    </pre>

    Note that this will block otherwise safe requests like ?top-40 so if you
    have query parameters that look like that, adjust your regex accordingly.</p>
    
    <p>Another set of releases are planned for Tuesday, May, 8th. These
    releases will fix the CGI flaw and another CGI-related issue in
    apache_request_header (5.4 only).</p>

    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience created with these releases and the
    (lack of) communication around them.</p>

        <div>
     
     <p>There is a vulnerability in certain CGI-based setups <b>(Apache+mod_php and nginx+php-fpm are not affected)</b>
     that has gone unnoticed for at least 8 years. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-robinson-www-interface-00#section-7">Section
     7 of the CGI spec</a> states:</p>
     
     <cite>
        Some systems support a method for supplying a [sic] array of strings to the
        CGI script. This is only used in the case of an `indexed' query. This
        is identified by a "GET" or "HEAD" HTTP request with a URL search
        string not containing any unencoded "=" characters.
     </cite>
     
     <p>So, requests that do not have a "=" in the query string are treated
     differently from those who do in some CGI implementations. For PHP this
     means that a request containing ?-s may dump the PHP source code for the
     page, but a request that has ?-s&amp;=1 is fine.</p>
     
     <p>A large number of sites run PHP as either an Apache module through
     mod_php or using php-fpm under nginx. Neither of these setups are
     vulnerable to this. Straight shebang-style CGI also does not appear to
     be vulnerable.</p>
     
     <p>If you are using Apache mod_cgi to run PHP you may be vulnerable. To see
     if you are, just add ?-s to the end of any of your URLs. If you see your
     source code, you are vulnerable. If your site renders normally, you are not.</p>
     
     <p>To fix this, update to PHP 5.3.12 or PHP 5.4.2. </p>
     
     <p>We recognize that since CGI is a rather outdated way to run PHP, it may not be feasible to
     upgrade these sites to a modern version of PHP. An alternative is to
     configure your web server to not let these types of requests with query
     strings starting with a "-" and not containing a "=" through. Adding a
     rule like this should not break any sites. For Apache using mod_rewrite
     it would look like this:</p>
     
     <pre>
         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(%2d|-)[^=]+$ [NC]
         RewriteRule ^(.*) $1? [L]
     </pre>
     
     <p>If you are writing your own rule, be sure to take the urlencoded ?%2ds
     version into account.</p>
     
     <p>Making a bad week worse, we had a bug in our bug system that toggled the
     private flag of a bug report to public on a comment to the bug report
     causing this issue to go public before we had time to test solutions to
     the level we would like. Please report any issues via <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">bugs.php.net</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Please help us to identify
        bugs in order to ensure that the release is solid and all things behave

    <p>
     The migration of the PHP source code from Subversion to Git is complete.
     You can clone or fork the source from our
     <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">GitHub mirror</a>, and we also
     now support pull requests made via GitHub. The source is also available
     via <a href="http://git.php.net/">git.php.net</a>, and full instructions
     on cloning the php-src tree can be found at
     <a href="http://php.net/git">php.net/git</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
     One immediate benefit is that future PHP release tags will be signed by
     the PHP development team. We will be releasing GPG keys for verification
     purposes in the next few days.
    </p>

    <p>
     More information on the migration and the new workflow can be found at the
     <a href="https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitfaq">Moving to Git FAQ</a> on the PHP
     Wiki.
    </p>

    <p>
     Please note that the PHP manual, including translations, continues to be
     hosted in Subversion for the time being and will be migrated to Git at a
     later date.
    </p>

    <p>
     Many thanks to David Soria Parra for his hard work on making the conversion
     to Git a reality, and to Alexander Moskaliov, Florian Anderiasch and
     Johannes Schlüter for their work on the scripts required to support
     the conversion. Let the forking begin!
