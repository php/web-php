<h1>PHP 4.2.2 released in response to vulnerability</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[22-Jul-2002]</span> The PHP Group today announced
 the details of a serious <a href="release_4_2_2.php">vulnerability</a> in
 PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. A security update, <a href="downloads.php">PHP
 4.2.2</a>, fixes the issue. Everyone running affected versions of PHP is
 encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 4.2.2 release doesn't include
 other changes, so upgrading from 4.2.1 is safe and painless.

<h1>New comp.lang.php newsgroup started</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[09-Jul-2002]</span> comp.lang.php was created yesterday,
 after a two and a half month long process started in April by Ian Fette resulted in a
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.php&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=1025483879.39561&amp;40isc.org&amp;rnum=3">177-11
 vote</a> in favor of the group. The new group is already carried on most news servers,
 and should be carried on almost all news servers in the world within the next few days.
</p>

<p>
 The new group is important for a few reasons: Firstly, the old alt.* php
 groups suffered from poor propagation - i.e. not all servers carried them,
 and the community was split between multiple groups. This new group offers a
 chance to unite the PHP-Usenet community. Secondly, most servers have longer
 post-retention times for comp.* than alt.*. Finally, the creation of
 comp.lang.php represents PHP's coming to acceptance and maturity. Virtually
 all languages have a spot under the comp.lang.* hierarchy. Stop on by and
 become a part of the community - comp.lang.php is a great place to get help
 and to help others.

 The second alpha release of PHP w/ Zend Engine 2 is <a href="/downloads.php">now
 available</a>. It is based on the current PHP 4 CVS (4.3.0-dev) and includes the new

 or even semi-production web sites. There are known bugs in it, and in
 addition, some of the features may change (based on feedback). We
 encourage you to download and play with it (and report bugs if you find any!),
 but please don't expect it to replace your copy of PHP 4 at this stage.
