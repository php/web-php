<p>
 Anybody who programs in PHP can be a contributing member of the community
 that develops and deploys it; the task of deploying PHP, documentation and
 associated websites is a never ending one. With every release, or release
 candidate comes a wave of work, which takes a lot of organization and
 co-ordination.
</p>

<p>
 With the introduction of release managers comes a smoother release process,
 but help is still needed: testing release candidates, finding and squashing
 bugs in tests, documentation, and sources.

<h3 class="content-header" id="php-src">Development of the PHP source</h3>

<div class="content-box">
<p>
 Someone hoping to become involved in the maintenance and development of
 the source should be experienced in all of the areas mentioned above, as
 this creates a strong team; everyone knows how every other part of the
 project works.
</p>

<p>
 You will also need experience in C programming as PHP is written entirely in C.
