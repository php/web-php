<h2 class="content-title">Contributing to PHP</h2>
<div class="content-box">

<p>
 Anybody who programs in PHP can be a contributing member of the community
 that develops and deploys it; the task of deploying PHP, documentation and
 associated websites is a never ending one. With every release, or release
 candidate comes a wave of work, which takes a lot of organization and
 co-ordination.
</p>

<p>
 With the introduction of release managers comes a smoother release process,
 but help is still needed: testing release candidates, finding and squashing
 bugs in tests, documentation, and sources.
</p>

<h3 class="content-title">Four Best Ways to Contribute</h3>

 <ol class="content-box listed">
  <li>Running test suites in <a href="http://qa.php.net/">RC</a>
      and <a href="http://php.net/releases">release</a> distributions of PHP</li>
  <li>Help finding and diagnosing failed tests, see
      the <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">phpt documentation</a></li>
  <li>Filing and resolving bug reports
      at <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bugs.php.net</a></li>
  <li>Help maintain and or translate documentation files
      at <a href="http://edit.php.net">edit.php.net</a>. Check out our
      <a href="http://doc.php.net/tutorial/">guide for contributors</a>.</li>
 </ol>

<h3 class="content-header">Development of the PHP source</h3>

<div class="content-box">
<p>
 Someone hoping to become involved in the maintenance and development of
 the source should be experienced in all of the areas mentioned above, as
 this creates a strong team; everyone knows how every other part of the
 project works. 
</p>

<p>
 You will also need experience in C programming as PHP is written entirely in C.
