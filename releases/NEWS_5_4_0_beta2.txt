- Improved Zend Engine memory usage: (Dmitry)
  . Replaced zend_function.pass_rest_by_reference by 
    ZEND_ACC_PASS_REST_BY_REFERENCE in zend_function.fn_flags.
  . Replaced zend_function.return_reference by ZEND_ACC_RETURN_REFERENCE
    in zend_function.fn_flags.
  . Removed zend_arg_info.required_num_args as it was only needed for internal
    functions. Now the first arg_info for internal functions (which has special
    meaning) is represented by zend_internal_function_info structure.
  . Moved zend_op_array.size, size_var, size_literal, current_brk_cont,
    backpatch_count into CG(context) as they are used only during compilation.
  . Moved zend_op_array.start_op into EG(start_op) as it's used only for 
    'interactive' execution of single top-level op-array.
  . Replaced zend_op_array.done_pass_two by ZEND_ACC_DONE_PASS_TWO in
    zend_op_array.fn_flags.

    in zend_class_entry.ce_flags.

    by different information for internal and user classes.
    See zend_class_entry.info union. 
  . Reduced size of temp_variable.

- Changed the structure of op_array.opcodes. The constant values are moved from
  opcode operands into a separate literal table. (Dmitry)

- Improved Zend Engine, performance tweaks and optimizations: (Dmitry)
  . Inlined most probable code-paths for arithmetic operations directly into
    executor.
  . Eliminated unnecessary iterations during request startup/shutdown.
  . Changed $GLOBALS into a JIT autoglobal, so it's initialized only if used.
    (this may affect opcode caches!)
  . Improved performance of @ (silence) operator.
  . Simplified string offset reading. $str[1][0] is now a legal construct.
  . Added caches to eliminate repeatable run-time bindings of functions,
    classes, constants, methods and properties.
  . Added concept of interned strings. All strings constants known at compile
    time are allocated in a single copy and never changed.
  . Added an optimization which saves memory and emalloc/efree calls for empty
    HashTables. (Stas, Dmitry)
  . ZEND_RECV now always has IS_CV as its result.
  . ZEND_CATCH now has to be used only with constant class names.
  . ZEND_FETCH_DIM_? may fetch array and dimension operands in different order.
  . Simplified ZEND_FETCH_*_R operations. They can't be used with the
    EXT_TYPE_UNUSED flag any more. This is a very rare and useless case.
    ZEND_FREE might be required after them instead.
  . Split ZEND_RETURN into two new instructions ZEND_RETURN and
    ZEND_RETURN_BY_REF.
  . Optimized access to global constants using values with pre-calculated
    hash_values from the literals table.
  . Optimized access to static properties using executor specialization.
    A constant class name may be used as a direct operand of ZEND_FETCH_*
    instruction without previous ZEND_FETCH_CLASS.
  . zend_stack and zend_ptr_stack allocation is delayed until actual usage.

- Improved CLI SAPI: (Johannes, Moriyoshi)
  . Added command line option --rz <name> which shows information of the
    named Zend extension. (Johannes)
  . Interactive readline shell improvements: (Johannes)
    . Added "cli.pager" php.ini setting to set a pager for output.
    . Added "cli.prompt" php.ini setting to configure the shell prompt.
    . Added shortcut #inisetting=value to change ini settings at run-time.
    . Changed shell not to terminate on fatal errors.
    . Interactive shell works with shared readline extension. FR #53878.

  . Added apache compatible functions: apache_child_terminate(),
    getallheaders(), apache_request_headers() and apache_response_headers()
  . Improved performance of FastCGI request parsing.

- Improved core functions:
  . number_format() no longer truncates multibyte decimal points and thousand
    separators to the first byte. FR #53457. (Adam)
  . Added hex2bin() function. (Scott)

  . Added support for CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE and
    CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE. FR #51815. (Pierrick)

  . Added the + modifier to parseFromFormat to allow trailing text in the
    string to parse without throwing an error. (Stas, Derick)

- Improved DBA extension:
  . Added Tokyo Cabinet abstract DB support. (Michael Maclean)
  . Added Berkeley DB 5 support. (Johannes, Chris Jones)

    FR #53407. (Adam)

- Improved HASH extension:
  . Added Jenkins's one-at-a-time hash support. (Martin Jansen)
  . Added FNV-1 hash support. (Michael Maclean)
  . Made Adler32 algorithm faster. FR #53213. (zavasek at yandex dot ru)

- Improved intl extension:
  . Added Spoofchecker, allows checking for visibly confusable characters and
    other security issues. (Scott)

- Improved JSON extension:
  . Added JsonSerializable interface. (Sara)
  . Added JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING, extended json_decode() sig with $options.
    (Sara)

    numeric strings to integers. (Ilia)
  . Added new json_encode() option JSON_PRETTY_PRINT. FR #44331. (Adam)
  . Added new json_encode() option JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES. FR #49366. (Adam)
