<h1>PHP 4.1.1 Release Announcement</h1>

<p>
 Due to a few bugs in PHP 4.1.0, we decided to release PHP 4.1.1.  The bugs
 that were fixed are not major ones but minor ones, which could be annoying
 if you get bitten by them.
</p>

<p>
 Our recommendation is that people who already upgraded to PHP 4.1.0 do
 <strong>not</strong> upgrade to <a href="/downloads.php">PHP 4.1.1</a>,
 unless they're experiencing one of the described bugs.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>No</strong> new features or security updates are available
 in this release.
</p>
