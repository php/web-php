     <p>Please note that according to the <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php">PHP version
support timelines</a>,
        PHP 5.6.40 is the last scheduled release of PHP 5.6 branch. There may be additional release if we
discover
        important security issues that warrant it, otherwise this release will be the final one in the PHP
5.6 branch.
        If your PHP installation is based on PHP 5.6, it may be a good time to start making the plans for
the upgrade
        to PHP 7.1, PHP 7.2 or PHP 7.3.
