<h1>PHP 4.4.6 Release Announcement</h1>
<p>
The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of
PHP 4.4.6.  This release addresses a crash problem with the session extension
when register_globals is turned on that was introduced in PHP 4.4.5. This
release comes also with the new version 7.0 of PCRE and it addresses a number
of minor bugs.
