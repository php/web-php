<h1 class="content-header">PHP.net: A Tourist's Guide</h1>
<p class="content-box">
 Everyone knows the <code>php.net</code> site. All of us went there sooner or later,
 and will keep going back there. This is the central reference point for PHP
 users, and there is a wealth of information there. Not all of it is obvious.
 Come with me, I'll show you.

 also <a href="/mirrors.php">mirrored in dozens of countries worldwide</a>.

 for Windows. The current and next-to-current versions are available there.
 (There is also a <a href="http://museum.php.net/">PHP Museum</a>, which has
 all of the source distributions since June 1996.)
</p>

<p>
 The next most visited section is the <a href="/docs.php">documentation</a>.
 The documentation is translated into twelve different languages, and is
 available in <a href="/download-docs.php">a variety of different formats</a>.
 Users are able to read notes on the documentation left by other users, and
 contribute their own notes. The documentation is a real community project
 by itself!
</p>

<p>
 The <a href="/support.php">support</a> page has all the directions to a wealth
 of resources both inside and outside of PHP.net. The community has built a huge
 network of knowledge bases, PHP user groups, and training sessions where anyone
 can have his or her questions answered. Non-English-speaking users also get a
 large share of attention.
