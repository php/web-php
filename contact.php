 Please report problems you find on PHP.net and mirror sites in

 as "PHP.net Website Problem". This allows us to follow the progress of
 the problem until it is fixed.

<p>
 For security related issues (in PHP or our websites) please contact
 <a href="mailto:security@php.net">security@php.net</a>.
 Please note that the following are <b>NOT</b> security issues:
 <ul>
  <li><b>Requests for help with using PHP.</b> Please use the
      <a href="mailto:php-general@lists.php.net">PHP General</a> mailing list.</li>
  <li><b>Source code to the PHP website(s) being publicly readable.</b>
      This is <i>on purpose</i>.
      All of the php.net websites are available publicly on github.
      For example, you can find this site at <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">github.com/php/web-php</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Requests for bug bounty payments.</b>
      PHP is run by volunteers with literally zero budget.
      The servers are donated hardware and bandwidth.
      Your bug reports and patches are appreciated, but we can not pay you for them.</li>
