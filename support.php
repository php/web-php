<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>
 A good place to start is by skimming through the ever-growing list of <a
 href="/FAQ.php">frequently asked questions (with answers, of course)</a>. Then
 have a look at the rest of the online manual and other resources in the <a
 href="/docs.php">documentation</a> section.
</p>

<h2 id="community-support">Community Support</h2>

</p>
<ul>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://phpc.chat/">phpc.chat</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://discord.gg/php-developers-484326318851358720">PHP Developers</a></li>

<h2 id="archive">Archive (Legacy Resources)</h2>

<h3 id="mailing-lists">Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>
 Historically, a number of mailing lists were devoted to talking about PHP and related projects. While
 many are no longer active, you can still find their descriptions and archives on <a href="mailing-lists.php">this page</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="newsgroups">Newsgroups</h3>
<p>
 The PHP language newsgroup is comp.lang.php. Many of our mailing lists were also reflected onto the news server at
 <a href="news://news.php.net">news://news.php.net/</a>. The server also has a read only web interface at
 <a href="https://news-web.php.net/">https://news-web.php.net/</a>.
</p>
<p>
 Please note that these are legacy resources and primarily useful for historical reference.
</p>

<h2 id="webmasters">PHP.net webmasters</h2>

<p>
 If you have a problem or suggestion <em>in connection with the PHP.net
 website</em>, <a href="/contact.php">please contact the webmasters</a>.
</p>
<p>
