<h1>PHP 4.2.2 released in response to vulnerability</h1>

<p>
<span class="newsdate">[22-Jul-2002]</span> The PHP Group today announced
the details of a serious <a href="release_4_2_2.php">vulnerability</a> in PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1.
A security update, <a href="downloads.php">PHP 4.2.2</a>, fixes the issue. Everyone running
affected versions of PHP is encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 4.2.2
release doesn't include other changes, so upgrading from 4.2.1 is safe and painless.

<h1>New comp.lang.php newsgroup started</h1>

<p>
<span class="newsdate">[09-Jul-2002]</span> comp.lang.php was created yesterday,
after a two and a half month long process started in April by Ian Fette resulted
in a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.php&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sel
m=1025483879.39561&amp;40isc.org&amp;rnum=3">177-11 vote</a> in favor of the group.
The new group is already carried on most news servers, and should be carried
on almost all news servers in the world within the next few days.
</p>

<p>
The new group is important for a few reasons: Firstly, the old alt.* php
groups suffered from poor propagation - i.e. not all servers carried them,
and the community was split between multiple groups. This new group offers a
chance to unite the PHP-Usenet community. Secondly, most servers have longer
post-retention times for comp.* than alt.*. Finally, the creation of
comp.lang.php represents PHP's coming to acceptance and maturity. Virtually
all languages have a spot under the comp.lang.* hierarchy. Stop on by and
become a part of the community - comp.lang.php is a great place to get help
and to help others.

or even semi-production web sites.  There are known bugs in it, and in
addition, some of the features may change (based on feedback).  We
encourage you to download and play with it (and report bugs if you find any!),
but please don't expect it to replace your copy of PHP 4 at this stage.</p>

Due to a security issue found in all versions of PHP (including 3.x and 4.x), a
new version of PHP has been released.  Details about the security issue are <a
href="http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html">available here</a>.
All users of PHP are strongly encouraged to either upgrade to <a
href="/downloads.php">PHP 4.1.2</a>, or install the patch (<a
href="/downloads.php">available for PHP 3.0.18, 4.0.6 and 4.1.0/4.1.1)</a>.

<h1>PHP-GTK 0.5.0 released</h1>

<p>
<span class="newsdate">[24-Jan-2002]</span>
<?php print_link("http://gtk.php.net/", "PHP-GTK"); ?> has reached version
0.5.0, also known as <em>"monday starts on saturday"</em>. The version number
was bumped from 0.1.1 to this one to indicate that PHP-GTK is now a fairly
mature and stable extension and can be used for a variety of applications
(just look on <?php print_link("http://www.freshmeat.net/", "Freshmeat"); ?>).
</p>

<p>
Also taking this opportunity, we would like to ask if some of you would
consider helping out with PHP-GTK documentation. It would be a great way to
learn this exciting extension and also contribute to the project.

PHP-GTK version 0.1 released</h1>

<p>
<span class="newsdate">[02-Aug-2001]</span>
The 0.1 release of PHP-GTK is now available. PHP-GTK is a PHP extension that provides an object-oriented interface
